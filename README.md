### Personal Website
Personal website, built off of https://github.com/mldangelo/personal-site.


# On making this
Was an interesting process to learn js/html/css with no prior experience in the languages. Was expecting a relatively straightforward experience
with customizing my website to my liking, but turned out that there was actually a surprisingly large amount of work to, given that
mldangelo had made his website "flexible" insofar as you wanted to keep the smae layouts/pages with only text modifications. Ultimately
ended up having to develop a pretty thorough understanding of how all the parts of his website functioned to get the changes I wanted working
properly (eg, being able to add new addresses/pages, changing the sidebar to only appear on the first page, editing formatting and wrappers).
Also learned that there ends up being a surprising amount of time spent on seemingly inoccuous tasks, like how to eliminate 
loading screen flickers, removing favicons, and even things like aligning text properly amidst a web of CSS dependencies.
