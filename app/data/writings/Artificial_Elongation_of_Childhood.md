### Artificial Elongation of Childhood
<br>
It's interesting to question whether society is suboptimally configured from 
how it treats childhood and adolescence. There's a lengthy path that's been 
laid out for children to go through before they are considered, treated as, and given
the responsibility associated with adults, but is this path intrinsic and neccessary, or 
did we come to establish it in an efficient, arbitrary way?
I don't consider myself to have thought through this extremely meticulously, so I hesitate 
to make any strong claims, but with that being said, my tentative thoughts seem to point
towards some genuine potential in the idea.
<br><br>
There's a lot of things to look at that point to children/adolescents being able to 
take on much more than we generally tend to give them. Anecdotally, I know
a fair amount of individuals who started school a year early (and not due to any
precocious brilliance) and more or less they all seem to be in similar places
to those who started school normally. Broadly throughout history, people
were also given responsibility much earlier, and seemed equipped to understand 
ideas and handle them.
<br><br>
I think the two core areas of development to consider are intellectual and
mental maturity. It seems that currently, the development of each is 
seen as tied to age, but I see the development as coming more from
events that coincide with age. In the straightforward intellectual sense, I'd
say that one could probably do away with most of elementary school without any real 
impact on intellectual development. Though there isn't a way to prove this in principal, 
my sense is that when I faced leaps in intellectual difficulty, say from high school to college,
it wouldn't have been any more difficult to make a similar leap earlier. The main difference is
just that I'm expected to make that leap as a college freshman, so there's some part of 
my mind that says I can't complain about the extra difficulty since it's expected of me.
But if the extra difficulty were expected earlier, would the end result/learning be any different?
It's an interesting question, though my sense leans towards no. People can do everything
at least one year earlier with virtually no noticeable change, and there also seem to be many examples of children
excelling in subjects not neccesarily from some precocious "intrinsic" ability, but rather
just having been introduced to certain advanced material at an early age. It would seem that 
we could likely push the development chain ahead by a few years with no loss of learning.
<br><br>
In terms of mental maturity, I think the development one sees through childhood/adolescence 
can be explained by a few key experiences who's effects likely aren't all that age dependent.
(If I had to be more specific, I'd add on that probably the most development comes from 
"negative" experiences and failures.) For instance, the college admissions process provides 
a novel amount of stress for high schoolers, many of who, for the first time, face 
the loss of a huge dream when rejected. This event alone probably explains a lot of 
what maturity difference exists between say, high school sophomores and college freshmen,
and you could probably have this experience occur at any point in adolescence while
resulting in a similar increase in maturity.
<br><br>
While the above is far from a robust argument, what makes this still worthwhile to
discuss are the huge ramifications this could have for the greater society from say, 
a utilitarian standpoint. If for instance, we could remove a few grades from elementary school with 
no harm to intellectual/mental development and have everyone start college at 16, 
we'd end up with a huge increase in the producer:dependent ratio. Two more years worth 
of individuals in the workforce and two less years of individuals who use resources
without significantly producing.
<br><br>
One might say that childhood, even if not productive/inefficient, is still valuable
for the child/adolescent in the moment, forming a utilitarian counterargument. 
My response would be that, at least anecdotally, enjoyment of childhood/adolescence 
seems to be romanticized and not terribly great for most. The lack of adult responsibility
allows for some enjoyable times, but I'd say that having responsibility doesn't 
have to coincide with a barrier to enjoyment. For instance, college is more 
enjoyable for the vast majority than high school, despite significantly more responsibility/stress.
Another point to address might be how it's so frequent to hear adults say something like
"I wish I were a kid again", but we should note that just because they say so
doesn't mean that being a kid was neccesarily all that valuable in the moment. 
First, we could note possible romanticization of childhood in those sentiments, and second,
we could also note that being able to "be a kid again" might gain some extra value only after
one has been an adult for some time (i.e., the value they're implicitly referencing
wouldn't neccesarily apply to one growing up and experiencing that childhood for the first time). 
<br><br>
All in all, if we could accelerate the societal path to adulthood without stunting intellectual/mental 
development, it seems there would be much to gain. There wouldn't seem to be too much, or perhaps
even anything, lost on an individual enjoyment basis, and there would be immense broad, societal
benefits from having an extra two years worth of a workforce. While we currently lack any highly concrete
evidence for what such an acceleration would exactly entail, there seems to be a reasonable argument for 
its possible net benefits.
