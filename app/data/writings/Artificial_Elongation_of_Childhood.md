### Artificial Elongation of Childhood
<br>
It's interesting to question whether society is suboptimally configured with regards to
how it treats childhood/adolescence. There's a lengthy path that's been 
laid out for children to go through before they are considered, treated as, and given
the responsibility associated with adults, but how optimal is this?
I don't consider myself to have thought through this extremely meticulously, so I hesitate 
to make any strong claims. With that being said though, my tentative view is that the path is needlessly long.
<br><br>
The broadest support for my tentative view comes from the idea of "nurture over nature". A lot of mental characteristics
are intuitively tied to genes/"biology", but generally speaking, evidence seems to point towards
environmental factors having stronger impacts. The mental "characteristics" associated with how one matures 
and develops are likely no exception to this. While we can observationally tie mental development/maturity to age, the development might
better be explained by the actual events occuring at certain ages. If the events themselves cause the developmental changes, 
then one might wonder to what extent they could be pushed forward and still retain the same impacts. Anecdotally, when looking 
at leaps I faced in intellectual difficulty (say from high school to college),
my sense is that it wouldn't have been any more difficult to make a similar leap somewhat earlier. 
I'm expected to make that leap as a college freshman, so there's some part of 
my mind that says I can't complain about the extra difficulty since it's expected of me at that point, but if it 
were expected a few years earlier, would my progress really be any different? It's hard to conclusively answer in any way,
but my sense leans towards no.
<br><br>
I would also view "mental"/non-intellectual maturity as similarly explainable in terms of "events".
For instance, the college admissions process provides a novel amount of stress for high schoolers, many of who, for the first time, face 
the loss of a huge dream when rejected. This event alone probably explains a lot of 
what's interpreted as a maturity gap between say, high school sophomores and college freshmen.
There also seems to be many cases I've come across, both personal and in reading, of younger individuals displaying mature qualities after having gone through
significant stress, which seems to point to potential for maturity to be realized arbitrarily early in adolescents. It's also probably worth noting that historically,
adolescents received significantly more responsibility than they currently do while not appearing to be any less capable than the young adults of today.
<br><br>
Any truth to the above ideas would seem to have fairly huge ramfications. 
If, for instance, we could remove a few grades from elementary school with 
no harm to intellectual/mental development and have everyone start college at 16, 
we'd end up with a huge increase in the producer:dependent ratio. Two more years worth 
of individuals in the workforce and two less years of individuals who use resources
without significantly producing would seem to amount to a huge utilitarian gain. 
One might say though that childhood, even if not productive/inefficient, is still valuable
for the child/adolescent in the moment. My response here would be that, at least anecdotally, enjoyment of childhood/adolescence 
seems to be romanticized and not terribly great for most. The lack of adult responsibility
allows for some genuinely enjoyable times, but I'd say what loss might exist there isn't neccessarily sufficient
to outweigh the other gains of increased responsibility. Additionally, having responsibility doesn't 
have to coincide with lower enjoyment either.
<br><br>
Another point to address might be how it's so frequent to hear adults say something like
"I wish I were a kid again", but we should note that just because they say so
doesn't mean that being a kid was neccesarily all that valuable in the moment. 
First, we could note possible romanticization of childhood in those sentiments, and second,
we could also note that being able to "be a kid again" might gain some extra value only after
one has been an adult for some time (i.e., the value they're implicitly referencing
wouldn't neccesarily apply to one growing up and experiencing that childhood for the first time). 
<br><br>
All in all, there seems a reasonable argument for accelerating the societal path to adulthood. There wouldn't seem to be too much, or perhaps
even anything, lost on an individual enjoyment basis, and there would be immense broad, societal
benefits from having an extra two years worth of a workforce.
