### Thoughts on my Music Education
<br>
It wouldn't be a stretch to say that for much of my adolescence,
my total time commitment to music (mainly violin) totalled around 
25-30 hours a week - two or more hours of practice daily, two lessons a week (with
a decent commute), Saturdays of chamber music, group classes, and orchestra at
the conservatory, and county orchestra on Sundays. For most of my adolescence, 
it was my primary engagement, endeavor, and source of stress. 
At times, I wonder if this intensity was all worthwhile compared to
choosing a less intense/no music education. There are plenty of positives and negatives to mention, 
but it's not immediately clear which might outweight the other. While the specific experiences I mention
are naturally only my own, I'm curious to see what tentative conclusions can be made.
<br><br>
In terms of the more tangible positives, I'd say my musical experiences instilled value through demanding
hard effort, meticulousness, and resilience. The hard effort is fairly 
self explanatory - pursuing anything at a competitive level takes a discipline and mental endurance
that's transferable to other things, and pursuing music is no exception. Signficant time must be spent 
on independently driven practice, and at the end of the day there's no one to really hold you accountable other than yourself.
<br><br>
The meticulousness is what I see as coming from the cultural emphasis on perfectionism. There exists no limit for how precise and exacting
a performance can be, and, perhaps as a result of past virtuosos pushing the ceiling ever so higher, the tolerance for
error is quite minute. Drilling the same short passage hundreds of times to really "secure" it for a performance or
focusing on exact, millimeter-perfect hand movements to ensure a perfectly smooth bow change are everyday parts of practice.
It's plausible that this is an overdone perfectionism, but at the very least, it hammers in the 
process of independently and meticulously refining a craft.
<br><br>
The resilience is something I see as coming from performance. You place yourself in an exposed position relative to
an expectant audience, and as you perform, regardless of what mistakes might occur, 
you have to continue with control of your nerves and some indifference to those watching. In addition to performance itself, there's
the development that comes with overcoming performance failure. While basically no performance is ever as good as you ideally wanted it to be,
there are performances that poor enough that you internally consider it as "objective" failure. You messed up the opening passage, 
were regularly out of tune/rhythym here and there, had your bow skitter on the cadences, and fell short on all the challenging passages. 
After hearing the audience still applaud or the judges' say "thank you", you're likely inclined to think of the response as no more than courtesy.
The experience/memory of the performance often feels disgraceful, and having spent so much time on intense refinement only for the actual performance 
to fail can be quite demoralizing. If for a competition/audition, the very tangible consequences aren't of much help either. 
Over time though, one learns how to better handle such scenarios. There's a shift from viewing them in a negative, personal way to
a more constructive, neutral way that better prepares one for future performances. In a more general sense, one might say this 
teaches you how to handle personal failure.
<br><br>
Moving on to the negatives/downsides, I'd say that an immediate thing to note is that for the 
vast majority, being skilled with an instrument offers little "practical" benefit. It's
not a skill that helps you academically or career-wise, and it's also 
not too socially valuable as an adult. In many ways, its relevance falls 
off the map quite quickly past high school, both in terms of how much people seem to care about it
and how much it can benefit you. The most tangible academic/career 
benefit is that my musical achievements helped me gain college admittances, but 
a) the admittance to "elite" over strong public universities is debatable, and b) 
there are probably much more efficient ways to cater to admissions should you wish to. If the sole objective is college admittance, 
one could probably gain more ground per unit of effort/time by say, founding interesting organizations/clubs,
pursuing leadership positions, and having a few creative or interesting flares that are eye-catching
without requiring huge investment. One might also just be able to say, invest a lot of time into advanced academic pursuit
alongside some low-commitment extracurriculars for well-roundedness, 
which would likely result in similar admissions chances alongside stronger future benefits.
<br><br>
Additionally, much of the musical experience itself is just not all that enjoyable. 
As alluded to earlier, there's a large amount of constant stress that comes with 
competitions, auditions, and performances, and more often than not, the results are
disappointing in some way, stirring negative emotion. Practicing is often an isolating
and frustrating routine, and orchestral rehearsals are rather unentertaining to be part of.
There were some solid highs I can point to, mainly from smaller group music experiences
and my summer with NYO, but it's a fairly sparse ratio of enjoyment:pain
compared to my impression of many other activites. What also comes to mind is that I see myself as 
having had a large stroke of luck to make it into NYO, which makes my expected enjoyment:pain ratio
that much lower.
<br><br>
Being able to play music for yourself seems like some sort of positive, but that depends on 
whether you're comfortable and respectful enough of your own playing to enjoy it. It's quite
infrequently that I play for myself, and when I do, I usually end up more focused on playing 
well than trying to enjoy my own music. I would by and large prefer a professional recording
if I'm looking to listen, though that does lead into what I might see as a possible redeeming element of my investment in music.
<br><br>
One thing that seems to be true is that, one way or another, I've ended up with a deep appreciation for music.
Not neccesarily appreciation for hearing my own playing or struggling in the practice room, but I find myself
able to have hugely indulgent/enveloping experiences listening to symphonies or concertos, where a fair
portion of my enjoyment seems to come from my knowledge of intricacies. This appreciation for/engagement with
music is also evident in my non-classical music listening as well. If this deep appreciation
is directly the result of my intensive music education, I might say that it seems worth it. I've already gotten
a mountain of enjoyment out of it, and I'll continue to enjoy that appreciation for the remainder of my life. Though naturally, it's
also not all that clear if the two are directly connected. My current deep appreciation might entirely be the 
result of an environmental correlation, or perhaps I could've cultivated a similarly deep interest with a sigificantly 
less intensive music education. Or perhaps this enjoyment is connected, but the opportunity cost of 
obtaining it might still have been a poor trade.
<br><br>
There's plenty of good and bad to reflect on, though
overall, I think my personal opinion of an intense music education leans slightly negative. My sense is that
the majority of the benefits one can get from a music education can come from a non-intensive one, 
and that more enjoyable and beneficial activities are out there for most people. Perhaps if 
a child shows a very early and genuine passion for their chosen instrument or highly precocious capabilities, it
might be worthwhile to pursue more intensive studies.
<br><br>
I wouldn't neccesarily say I regret my music experiences, and there was definitely a fair amount of good that came from them.
All things considered though, I wouldn't be one to eagerly advocate for it either.
