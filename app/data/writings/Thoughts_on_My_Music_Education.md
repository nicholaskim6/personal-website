### Thoughts on my Music Education
<br>
It wouldn't be a stretch to say that for much of my adolescence,
my total time commitment to music (mainly violin) totalled around 
25-30 hours a week - two or more hours of practice daily, two lessons a week (with
a decent commute), Saturdays of chamber music, group classes, and orchestra at
the conservatory, and county orchestra on Sundays. I sometimes wonder if this intensity was all worthwhile, and whether it would've
been better to either have a less intensive music education or perhaps no music education.
<br><br>
Overall, I think my opinion of an intense music education leans somewhat negative. My sense is that
the majority of the benefits one can get from a music education can come from a non-intensive one, 
and that more enjoyable and beneficial activities are out there for most people. Perhaps if 
a child shows an early, genuine passion for their chosen instrument or highly precocious capabilities, it
might be worthwhile to pursue more intensive studies. Mostly though, an intensive music education
is stressful, time-consuming, and difficult while seemingly lacking proportional immediate or future benefit.
That's not to say that it's a terrible thing to put someone through or the worst decision possible, but
my sense is that for most, it's a suboptimal commitment to make.
<br><br>
I want to preface the following paragraphs by saying that I'm far from believing that this was 
anywhere near the worst possible usage of my time. I'm also
quite appreciative of the positive experiences I had and the general development I realized from intensely pursuing
a craft/goal. That being said, I think it's still worthwhile to understand the 
overall justifiability of such a large, impactful commitment that many consider pursuing, and where it 
might stand in terms of opportunity cost.
<br><br>
Probably the first thing that comes to mind is that being a fairly
skilled classical musician doesn't seem to have too many "real-world" benefits. It's
not a skill that helps me academically or career-wise, and it's also 
not too socially valuable as an adult. In many ways, its relevance falls 
off the map quite quickly, both in terms of how much people seem to care about it
and how much it can benefit you. The majority of my musical friends haven't really 
made much use of their instruments since high school, and their strong musical abilities 
are more or less a personal footnote. The most tangible academic/career 
benefit is that my musical achievements helped me gain college admittances, but 
a) the admittance to "elite" over strong public universities is debatable, and b) 
there are probably much more efficient ways to cater to admissions should you wish to. If the sole objective is college admittance, 
one could probably gain more ground per unit of effort/time by say, founding interesting organizations/clubs,
pursuing leadership positions, and having a few creative or interesting flares that are eye-catching
without requiring huge investment. One might also just be able to say, invest a lot of time into academic studying (for instance, math/coding competitions
and/or advanced study outside of school) alongside some low-commitment extracurriculars for well-roundedness, 
which would likely result in similar admissions chances alongside stronger future benefits.
<br><br>
In addition to the above concerns regarding practicality, much of the musical experience
is not all that enjoyable (an opinion of both myself and many of my friends). 
There's a large amount of constant stress that comes with 
competitions, auditions, and performances, and more often than not, the results are
disappointing in some way, stirring negative emotion. Practicing was often an isolating
and frustrating routine, and orchestral rehearsals are rather unentertaining to be part of.
There were a handful of highs I could point to personally, mainly from smaller group music experiences
and my summer with NYO, but it's a fairly sparse ratio of enjoyment:pain
compared to many other activites. What also comes to mind is that if I hadn't had a large stroke of luck to make it into NYO, 
my enjoyment:pain ratio from violin-related experiences would look truly dismal.
<br><br>
Being able to play music for yourself seems like some sort of positive, but that depends on 
whether you're comfortable and respectful enough of your own playing to enjoy it. It's quite
infrequently that I play for myself, and when I do, I usually end up more focused on playing 
well than trying to enjoy my own music. I would by and large prefer a professional recording
if I'm looking to listen, though that does lead into what I might see as a possible redeeming element of my investment in music.
<br><br>
One thing that seems to be true is that, one way or another, I've ended up with a deep appreciation for music.
Not neccesarily appreciation for hearing my own playing or struggling in the practice room, but I find myself
able to have hugely indulgent/enveloping experiences listening to symphonies or concertos, where a fair
portion of my enjoyment seems to come from my knowledge of intricacies. This appreciation for/engagement with
music is also evident in my non-classical music listening as well. If this deep appreciation
is directly the result of my intensive music education, I might say that it seems worth it. I've already gotten
a mountain of enjoyment out of it, and I'll continue to enjoy that appreciation for the remainder of my life. Though naturally, it's
also not all that clear if the two are directly connected. My current deep appreciation might entirely be the 
result of an environmental correlation, or perhaps I could've cultivated a similarly deep interest with a sigificantly 
less intensive music education. Or perhaps this enjoyment is connected, but the opportunity cost of 
obtaining it might still have been a poor trade.
<br><br>
All in all, I wouldn't neccesarily say I strongly regret my music experiences, and there was definitely some good that came from them.
That being said, I also wouldn't say there's enough for me to advocate for pursuing this commitment over a number of alternatives.
