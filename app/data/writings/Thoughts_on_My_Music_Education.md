### Thoughts on my Music Education
<br>
It wouldn't be a stretch to say that for much of my adolescence,
my total time commitment to music (mainly violin) totalled around 
25-30 hours a week - two or more hours of practice daily, two lessons a week (with
a decent commute), Saturdays of chamber music, group classes, and orchestra at
the conservatory, and county orchestra on Sundays. Without exaggeration, it was the dominant
element in my adolescent life. It was my main engagement/effort, endeavor, and source of stress, far beyond
what school at the time presented me. I sometimes wonder if this intensity was all worthwhile compared to
choosing a less intense/no music education.
<br><br>
In terms of the more tangible positives, I'd say my musical experiences instilled value through demands of
hard effort, meticulousness, and resilience. The hard effort is fairly 
self explanatory - pursuing anything at a competitive level takes a discipline and mental endurance
that's transferable to other endeavors, and pursuing music is no exception. Hours upon hours must be spent 
on independently driven practice, and at the end of the day there's no one to hold you accountable other than yourself.
<br><br>
The meticulousness is what I see as coming from the cultural emphasis on perfectionism. There exists no limit for how precise and exacting
a performance can be, and, perhaps as a result of past virtuosos pushing the ceiling ever so higher, the tolerance for
error is quite minute. This manifests in both "macro" and "micro" ways. For instance, say there's quite a difficult passage
in one section. At first, you can't play it at all, but practice hard and after several days, you can play it without falling
apart 40% of the time. After more days, you hit 60%, and then 70%, and then 75%. But a 25% chance of falling apart in any section
is far below an acceptable standard for a performance (competitions in particular), so you'll have to practice that section 
through the diminshing %gain/hour rate all the way until say, 99% confidence, and even then you might still feel an insecurity
and continue to practice it over and over. In a more micro sense, things like a single key out of tune note can effectively ruin a performance, as can 
a bad rhythym or even just a flawed phrasing or dynamic contrast. Even things like the smoothness of bow changes in a slow section or the 
vibrato require plenty of refinement. One might even say this is an unhealthy perfectionism, but at the very least, it hammers in the 
process of independently and meticulously refining a craft.
<br><br>
The resilience is something I see as coming from performance. On one hand, the actual act of performing requires 
resilience to what can be summed up as stage-fright. You place yourself in a vulnerable position relative to
an expectant audience, and as you perform, regardless of what mistakes might occur, 
you have to continue the performance with control of your nerves and indifference to those watching. A more personal, arguably deeper
resilience is the kind that comes with overcoming performance failure. While basically no performance is ever as good as you ideally wanted it to be,
there are performances that poor enough that you internally consider it as "objective" failure. You messed up the opening passage, 
were regularly out of tune/rhythym here and there, had your bow skitter on the cadences, and botched all the challenging passages. 
After hearing the audience still applaud or the judges' "thank you", your first thought is that it's surely just being done out of courtesy.
The experience/memory of the performance itself feels something like public humiliation, and having spent so much time on intense refinement only for the actual performance 
to fail is often deeply demoralizing. And if for a competition/audition, those feelings really linger since there are quite tangible consequences. 
And yet, in spite of those natural sentiments, you have to continue on with practicing and preparing for the next
performance. Over time and with more failures, you slowly learn how to cope with them better, and while they never don't sting in some way or another, 
they end up far from debilitating.
<br><br>
Moving on to the negatives/downsides, I'd say that an immediate thing to note is that for the 
vast majority, being skilled with an instrument offers little "practical" benefit. It's
not a skill that helps you academically or career-wise, and it's also 
not too socially valuable as an adult. In many ways, its relevance falls 
off the map quite quickly past high school, both in terms of how much people seem to care about it
and how much it can benefit you. The most tangible academic/career 
benefit is that my musical achievements helped me gain college admittances, but 
a) the admittance to "elite" over strong public universities is debatable, and b) 
there are probably much more efficient ways to cater to admissions should you wish to. If the sole objective is college admittance, 
one could probably gain more ground per unit of effort/time by say, founding interesting organizations/clubs,
pursuing leadership positions, and having a few creative or interesting flares that are eye-catching
without requiring huge investment. One might also just be able to say, invest a lot of time into advanced academic pursuit
alongside some low-commitment extracurriculars for well-roundedness, 
which would likely result in similar admissions chances alongside stronger future benefits.
<br><br>
Additionally, much of the musical experience itself is just not all that enjoyable. 
As alluded to earlier, there's a large amount of constant stress that comes with 
competitions, auditions, and performances, and more often than not, the results are
disappointing in some way, stirring negative emotion. Practicing is often an isolating
and frustrating routine, and orchestral rehearsals are rather unentertaining to be part of.
There were some solid highs I can point to, mainly from smaller group music experiences
and my summer with NYO, but it's a fairly sparse ratio of enjoyment:pain
compared to my impression of many other activites. What also comes to mind is that I myself as 
having had a large stroke of luck to make it into NYO, which makes my/others expected enjoyment:pain ratio
that much lower.
<br><br>
Being able to play music for yourself seems like some sort of positive, but that depends on 
whether you're comfortable and respectful enough of your own playing to enjoy it. It's quite
infrequently that I play for myself, and when I do, I usually end up more focused on playing 
well than trying to enjoy my own music. I would by and large prefer a professional recording
if I'm looking to listen, though that does lead into what I might see as a possible redeeming element of my investment in music.
<br><br>
One thing that seems to be true is that, one way or another, I've ended up with a deep appreciation for music.
Not neccesarily appreciation for hearing my own playing or struggling in the practice room, but I find myself
able to have hugely indulgent/enveloping experiences listening to symphonies or concertos, where a fair
portion of my enjoyment seems to come from my knowledge of intricacies. This appreciation for/engagement with
music is also evident in my non-classical music listening as well. If this deep appreciation
is directly the result of my intensive music education, I might say that it seems worth it. I've already gotten
a mountain of enjoyment out of it, and I'll continue to enjoy that appreciation for the remainder of my life. Though naturally, it's
also not all that clear if the two are directly connected. My current deep appreciation might entirely be the 
result of an environmental correlation, or perhaps I could've cultivated a similarly deep interest with a sigificantly 
less intensive music education. Or perhaps this enjoyment is connected, but the opportunity cost of 
obtaining it might still have been a poor trade.
<br><br>
There's plenty of good and bad to reflect on, though
overall, I think my opinion of an intense music education leans slightly negative. My sense is that
the majority of the benefits one can get from a music education can come from a non-intensive one, 
and that more enjoyable and beneficial activities are out there for most people. Perhaps if 
a child shows a very early and genuine passion for their chosen instrument or highly precocious capabilities, it
might be worthwhile to pursue more intensive studies.
<br><br>
I wouldn't neccesarily say I regret my music experiences, and there was definitely a fair amount of good that came from them.
All things considered though, I wouldn't be one to eagerly advocate for it either.
