### Some Things I've Learned from Philosophy
<br>
I spend a sizeable amount of time on philosophy, and a natural
question that comes up is if doing this is actually useful. While
there are some pretty clear ways in which thinking through a philosophy/philosophy-esque problem
ends up being useful in some immediately tangible way, like when one evaluates
something as morally good/bad, there are also a lot of cases
where the problems get so abstract that it's hard to see an immediate relevance.
<br><br>
While it sounds a bit cliche, I think that even by thinking about those less
immediately practical problems, I end up getting a lot out of them from
how they cultivate fundamental critical thinking skills. The lessons and takeaways
from thinking through these problems are often widely applicable, and
I find myself applying them quite pervasively in everyday thoughts and debates.
<br><br>
I'd summarize a few of the general takeaways that 
philosophy has reinforced for me as follows.
<br><br>
Skepticism - I'd consider this the most concise and overarching takeaway. 
In philosophy, you end up coming across many strong arguments
for things that seem intuitively nonsensical at first. Regularly seeing that disconnect
between my immediate reactions and what could actually conceivably be argued
for led me towards the notion that beliefs should generally trend towards neutrality
and that I should strongly emphasize hesitance when accepting/rejecting ideas.
<br><br>
The importance of understanding things at generalizable levels - A lot of our understanding, when not particularly attended to,
tends to be "patch-worky"/ad-hoc. We develop understanding of specific cases and fit unique mental frameworks around each case,
but more often than not, there are unifying threads that can simplify as well as clarify understanding. Finding
and understanding those threads is key for being able to efficiently approach new cases and scenarios.
<br><br>
Using limiting cases/Analogies - A quick way to stress test almost any premise/idea is 
to see how they hold up under limiting parameter values or scenarios. In addition to being able to challenge some 
final conclusions directly, it's also fairly common that conclusions are justified under the 
guise of some overarching/categorical premise X, when their true justification (or potential justification) 
lies in something more to do with the specific scenario. In the latter case, a limiting case which
disproves X does not neccesarily make the conclusion false, but helps greatly to recenter
discussion on the relevant ideas.
<br><br>
The importance of semantics - It's exceedingly important to carefully define the relevant
terms in any discussion, and the more I pay attention to this, the more I see that it's
a surprisingly common source of frustration/confusion in discussions. The same word can be interpreted wildly differently by various people, and 
many debates seem to actually be two people agreeing who don't realize they agree because of semantic confusion. Proactively ironing out any potential
differences in interpretation during a discussion eases a lot of needless derailment.
