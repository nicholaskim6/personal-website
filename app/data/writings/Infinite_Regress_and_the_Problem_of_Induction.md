### Infinite Regress and the Problem of Induction
<br>
"Infinite Regress" and the "Problem of Induction" are two core issues which stand at the
forefront of epistemic skepticism. While the problems are surprisingly straightforward,
they seem to present a serious challenge to our knowledge claims and beliefs while also
being intertwined in interesting ways.
<br><br>
Infinite Regress stems from the notion that any statement requires justifying statements to 
be considered true. Since justifying statements also require justifications themselves, 
this leads either to an infinite required chain of justification or a brute-forced assumption.
This isn't such a problem in terms of humanly-defined statements, but seems to quickly pose 
headaches when extending to anything beyond. For instance, there's no "problem" in me
stating my pencil is blue, since I am not trying to say anything about the world other than 
that a) I have come up with some definition of blue, and b) the pencil's color fits that 
definition of blue. However, say I'm trying to understand why a particle has a certain property
or why one moral theory takes precedence over another. For the former, regress poses a challenge 
for ever having a truly comprehensive understanding of a phenomena, and for the latter, regress
poses an extreme challenge to have any understanding at all. (As a side note, Infinite Regress 
is not the only "option", in that it is actually one of three potential choices in what's known as the
"Agrippan Trilemma" for how one might prove an idea. I see it as the most important choice to 
think about since it seems to be what most people intuitively/implicitly support, 
but want to note the base idea is technically debatable.)
<br><br>
The Problem of Induction is the idea that belief in induction cannot rationally be justified. 
Since there doesn't seem to be any way to deductively prove induction without already having
an inductively justified premise, and since inductive belief in induction would be circular, 
the conclusion seems to be that belief in induction is irrational/unfounded. A first thought that 
often comes up is that inductive ideas, say, this door will break if I punch it, can evade 
the skepticism by appealing to more fundamentally true ideas (e.g., the laws of physics), though
closer inspection would reveal that believe in those more fundamental ideas cannot escape
this inductive skepticism. It might still be the case that induction is right somehow, but at the very least, 
this argument seems to be able to say that inductive belief is inconsistent with our current criteria for rational belief.
Perhaps induction is correct as a law, but our language/logical structure for justifying belief 
breaks down when the justification target is self-referential (justification of justified belief),
maybe in some abstractly similar way to how the truth values of sentences break down with 
self-reference as well ("this statement is false"). Or perhaps induction is not correct as a law, but
by chance, we're in a particular time and place where reality happens to match induction's conclusions (like someone 
who incorrectly believes some wiener process is not actually random, but has made predictions that just happen
to align with the wiener process for a bit).
<br><br>
The interplay of these two ideas is fairly interesting to look at, in that they seem to synergistically
reinforce the skeptical consequences of each other. For instance, one can argue that Infinite Regress is 
the key idea behind why one cannot deductively prove an inductive claim without referring to a deeper inductive claim
, or one can argue that the Problem of Induction renders "deeper deductive understanding" of
things like particles to be meaningless.
<br><br>
Let's return to the door example, where someone makes the "inductive" claim
that the door will break if they punch it, since they are sure everything obeys the laws of physics. In a raw sense,
what they are actually doing is "kicking the bucket down" to an inductive claim regarding how particles
will interact ("I've seen/heard of particles interacting roughly in accordance with newtonian physics all my life,
and have no reason to believe they will change"). If one does not want to believe in the laws of physics inductively,
then they should be able to prove them deductively, but due to regress, the deductive proof can never be complete.
Even if one were somehow to arrive at a set of premises with the conclusion "the apparent laws of physics are true", 
they would be left with deductively proving the premises ad infinitum. (And additionally, if one takes an 
empiricist angle to how one acquires knowledge, one would say that to even reach and start reasoning with any 
premises at all, one must be making inductive inferences). 
<br><br>
For Infinite Regress and deductive reasoning, the Problem of Induction also plays a key role. Because 
we require all statements taken as true to be qualified/justified, if one tries to reason purely deductively 
about something, they will be left in an infinite regress of explanation. There is no "bedrock" statement
one will hit that one can ignore further justification for, so to "ground" these chains in something
that can be taken as true/reasonably true, we defer to induction. We observe something many times, then 
come to accept is as likely true, and then use that claim as bedrock for the reasoning chains, 
but if the Problem of Induction holds true, then the bedrock we choose on this basis 
cannot rationally be justified, thus eliminating our key tool for starting any chain of reasoning/belief.
<br><br>
While I've only really scratched the surface of the two issues, I hope the 
above does some justice to introducing the deep ramifications these ideas may have for 
rational belief.
