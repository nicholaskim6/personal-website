### Music
Most days, I'm listening to music more than I'm not. I consider myself quite passionate
about all-things music and will often spend entire evenings solely on indulging in a few pieces.
Currently, my music taste is approximately 30% classical, 15% indie rock, 
15% metal/classic rock, 10% prog rock, 10% contemporary R&B/Soul/Hip hop,
and 20% other.

I enjoy playing violin, piano, and bass guitar, and much of my teenage and childhood years
were focused on practicing violin and participating in orchestras/competitions. In 2016,
I was a member of the [National Youth Orchestra of the USA](https://www.carnegiehall.org/Education/Young-Musicians/National-Youth-Ensembles/NYO-USA/NYO-USA-2016)
, which I consider to be among my most memorable experiences. From time to time, I also experiment
with composition.

### Philosophy
Before elaborating on my specific interest in philosophy, I should first clarify what
academic philosophy entails and the nature of "analytic" vs other kinds of philosophy.
The colloquial sense of philosophy is somewhat literary/aristic, tending to be
associated with sentimental questions like "the meaning of existence" or "how to approach life".
The academic sense of philosophy is closer to science than it is to art, and seeks to 
understand concrete concepts at fundamental levels via rigorous logical argument. Within academic philosophy, 
there's still a decent spectrum of literary to logical,
and, roughly speaking, things closer to the logical side are termed
"analytic" philosophy, which is my primary interest.
<br><br>
As mentioned on my "about me" page, I find it stimulating to try and understand things fundamentally and to 
question the roots of many of our/my assumptions. Overt time, this interest naturally led me to philosophy.
Currently, my main areas of interest are epistemology, metaphysics, and ethics. Particularly with
regards to epistemology and ethics, there's an inescapable relevance to these topics that strongly motivates me to engage with them.
For fun, I've included some of my tentative opinions/leanings on prominent philosophical debates below.
<br><br>
A Priori Knowledge - __No__ || Abstract Objects - __Nominalism__ || Aesthetic Value - __ill-defined__ ||
Analytic-Synthetic Distinction - __Yes__ || Epistemic Justification - __Externalism__ || 
External World - __Idealism__ || Free Will - __No__ || Knowledge Claims - __Invariantism__ ||
Knowledge - __Empiricism__ || Mind - __Physicalism__ || Normative Ethics - __Consequentialism__ ||

### Gaming
The first thing I'd say gaming offers to me is an outlet for competition and challenging myself. When playing
online against others, there's immediate feedback on how you perform
and a clear metric for your overall standing. Working to improve your 
strategy/execution and then concretely seeing that standing progress is satisfying to me in many ways.
A few of my noteworthy peak rankings in popular competitive strategy games are -
<br><br>
- League of Legends - 99.5th Percentile <br>
- Hearthstone - 99.5th Percentile <br>
- StarCraft 2 - 98th Percentile <br>

I'm also active in the League of Legends eSports scene. I led my high school team in 2015
to HSL national playoffs, and have also competed regularly in the Collegiate League (CSL) 
on Princeton's team. This year, I also participated in a charity [eSports tournament](https://tiltify.com/@yaleesports/ivy-vs-covid-19-12-hour-charity-stream) 
hosted by the Ivy League + Stanford/MIT which raised $16.5k (including matched donations) for
COVID-19 relief.
<br><br>
In addition to multiplayer games, I also enjoy immersive, story-driven singleplayer games here and there.
Some of my favorite titles include Bioshock, The Last of Us, and Mass Effect.

### History
I would summarize my interest in history as an interest in the extremes of human experience.
I find it mind-boggling to vicariously think through what many people in the past experienced,
particularly in the context of wars. With only my comparatively mundane experiences as a reference,
it's almost inconceivable to imagine what, only 80 years ago, a soviet conscript would've experienced
bitterly fighting in Stalingrad. Constant life or death engagements and brutal living conditions
against the backdrop of a massive war that threatened the entire existence of his country is 
many worlds away from anything I've experienced, and I find that disparity fascinating to 
think and learn more about. My primary historical interest is in WW2, though I've also
recently been exploring more about WW1 and the Crusades.
