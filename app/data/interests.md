### Music
Most days, I'm listening to music more than I'm not.
Currently, my music taste is approximately 30% classical, 15% indie rock, 
15% metal/classic rock, 10% prog rock, 10% contemporary R&B/Soul/Hip hop,
and 20% other.

I enjoy playing violin, piano, and bass guitar, and much of my teenage and childhood years
were focused on practicing violin and participating in orchestras/competitions. In 2016,
I was a member of the [National Youth Orchestra of the USA](https://www.carnegiehall.org/Education/Young-Musicians/National-Youth-Ensembles/NYO-USA/NYO-USA-2016)
, which I consider to be among my most memorable experiences.
<br><br>
From time to time, I also experiment
with composition. Below is a recent original work of mine, inspired by orchestral film scores.

### Philosophy
I should first clarify a distinction between the colloquial and academic senses of "philosophy", since my 
specific interests lie with only the latter. The colloquial sense of philosophy is somewhat literary/aristic, tending to be
associated with sentimental impressions and questions like "the meaning of existence" or "how to approach life", whereas 
the academic sense of philosophy is closer to science than it is to art, seeking to 
understand concrete concepts at fundamental levels via rigorous logical argument.
<br><br>
I've always found it stimulating to try and understand things fundamentally and to 
question the roots of our general assumptions. Over time, this interest naturally led me to philosophy.
Currently, my main areas of interest are epistemology, metaphysics, and ethics, which I enjoy for both
the topics themselves as well as their pervasive relevance.
I've included some of my tentative opinions/leanings on prominent philosophical debates below.
<br><br>
A Priori Knowledge - __No__ || Abstract Objects - __Nominalism__ || Aesthetic Value - __ill-defined__ ||
Analytic-Synthetic Distinction - __Yes__ || Epistemic Justification - __Externalism__ || 
External World - __Idealism__ || Free Will - __No__ || Knowledge Claims - __Invariantism__ ||
Knowledge - __Empiricism__ || Mind - __Physicalism__ || Normative Ethics - __Consequentialism__ ||

### Gaming
The first thing I'd say gaming offers to me is an outlet for competition and challenging myself. Working to improve your 
strategy/execution and then concretely seeing the results as your ranking progresses is satisfying to me in many ways.
A few of my noteworthy peak rankings in popular competitive strategy games are -
<br><br>
- League of Legends - 99.5th Percentile <br>
- Hearthstone - 99.5th Percentile <br>
- StarCraft 2 - 98th Percentile <br>

I'm also active in the League of Legends eSports scene. I led my high school team in 2015
to HSL national playoffs, and have also competed regularly in the Collegiate League (CSL) 
on Princeton's team. This year, I also participated in a charity [eSports tournament](https://tiltify.com/@yaleesports/ivy-vs-covid-19-12-hour-charity-stream) 
hosted by the Ivy League + Stanford/MIT which raised $16.5k (including matched donations) for
COVID-19 relief.
<br><br>
In addition to multiplayer games, I also enjoy immersive, story-driven singleplayer games here and there.
Some of my favorite titles include Bioshock, The Last of Us, and Mass Effect.

### History
I would summarize my interest in history as an interest in the extremes of human experience.
I find it fascinating to vicariously imagine what many people in the past experienced,
particularly in the context of wars. With only my comparatively mundane experiences as a reference,
it's almost inconceivable to imagine what, say, a russian soldier would've experienced day to day while
bitterly fighting in Stalingrad. The sheer disparity between my own and their experiences is something I find engaging
to think and learn about. My primary historical interest is in WW2, though I've also
recently been exploring more about WW1. I also enjoy casually reading firsthand historical accounts
from any time period.
