### Intro
I'm currently a rising senior at Princeton in the Operations Research and Financial Engineering 
(applied math/stat) program pursuing minors in CS, statistics/ML, and philosophy.

My summer internship experiences -
- __2020__ - Doing remote work with [__XR Trading__](http://www.xrtrading.com/) conducting statistical studies on predictors of retail interest.
- __2020 (Cancelled due to COVID-19)__ - Trading intern at [__Belvedere Trading__](http://www.belvederetrading.com/) in Chicago. Will still be 
completing optional in-house coursework on options theory.
- __2019__ - Options trading intern at [__XR Trading__](http://www.xrtrading.com/) in NYC. I worked with a desk focused on event trading, 
where I wrote Python scripts for event analysis/response, statistically analyzed volatility shock factors, and studied options theory. I also
did some development work in C# where I replaced an outdated accessor for an implied volatility database.
- __2018__ - Software engineering/NLP research intern at [__QARASoft__](https://www.qara.ai/) in Seoul, South Korea. I worked on the development
of a news-based NLP stock prediction tool that would be deployed to KOSHO, a robo-advisor investment app. I worked primarily in Python and 
spent time studying NLP, general finance, and web scraping.
<br>

Profesionally, my current primary interest is in finance. Within finance, I'm particularly interested in trading given its competitive
elements, meritocratic structure, and open-endedness. Additionally, I'm interested in data science as well as any roles (quantitative or non-quantitative) 
that strongly emphasize analytical thinking.
<br><br>
My preferred language for general programming/data analysis is Python. I also have limited experience 
with R, C/C++/C#, and Java. 
<br><br>
Aside from quantitative finance, I have a strong interest 
in analytic philosophy and the kind of thinking/debating that comes with it.
