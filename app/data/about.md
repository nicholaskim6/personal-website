### Intro
I'm currently a third year student at Princeton in the Operations Research and Financial Engineering 
(applied math/stat) program pursuing minors in CS, statistics/ML, and philosophy. 
I enjoy spending my free time on music, philosophy, history, gaming, and taking long walks.
<br>
<br>
Profesionally, my current primary interest is in finance with particular emphasis on trading/markets. Additionally, I'm interested in data science
as well as any roles (quantitative or non-quantitative) that strongly emphasize analytical thinking.

My summer internship experiences -
- __2020 (Cancelled due to COVID-19)__ - Trading intern at [__Belvedere Trading__](http://www.belvederetrading.com/) in Chicago.
- __2019__ - I was an options trading intern at [__XR Trading__](http://www.xrtrading.com/) in NYC. I worked with a desk focused on event trading, 
where I wrote Python scripts for event analysis/response, statistically analyzed volatility shock factors, and studied options theory.
- __2018__ - I was a software engineering/NLP research intern at [__QARASoft__](https://www.qara.ai/) in Seoul, South Korea. I worked on the development
of a news-based NLP stock prediction tool that would be deployed to KOSHO, a robo-advisor investment app.

### More on myself

I spend a good amount of time thinking about fairly random things. Open-ended questions/thoughts tend to frequently pop up in my head, and
I find it stimulating to try to break down and understand these ideas at fundamental, generalizable levels. In addition to thinking about these things on my own, 
I also enjoy debating them with others when possible. A few topics I frequently find myself thinking about are moral justifications, 
societal assumptions, and hypothetical explanations. If a thought comes up when I'm busy and can't give it my full attention, 
I like to record it in a file so that I can revisit it later.
<br><br>
I have a strong liking for music. Listening to, playing, and occasionally composing music makes up a significant portion
of my general enjoyment. I first became involved with music at a young age when I started violin lessons, though I wasn't particularly appreciative
of what music had to offer until high school. Since then, it's been a constant source of deep enjoyment.
Some latent related interests I have include algorithmic analysis of music and automated music generation.
<br><br>
Gaming is another favorite pasttime of mine. I mostly enjoy the more competitively-oriented multiplayer games, but also appreciate
an immersive, story-driven singleplayer game from time to time. History is also fascinating to me, where I particularly appreciate thinking through and attempting to vicariously experience
the experiences of individuals during historical events.

### Some general ideas I value

- Skepticism, both for your own and others' views

- Hesitating to generalize your own specific experiences

- Proving views by unsuccessfully attempting to disprove

- Acknowledging the complexity of most things
